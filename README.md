A natural and minimalist website for an alternative medicine practitioner based in County Clare, Ireland.
This practitioner is a therapist and teacher in Qigong and Amatsu but is also a qualified chef and a home gardener all related by his passion about living better, happier and in a more natural way. He knows how important it is to keep the body, mind and soul in balance which makes him very passionate to share and teach with others.

Because of the absence of knowledge and interest in these types of practices coupled with the very amateurish existing websites for those types of practices, the main goal of the website is to give a basic intro while not overloading with too much content, having a modern designed, minimalist and relaxed website for both already convinced or new clients and to guide everyone towards useful knowledge to apply or contact directly the practitioner for more.

During strategy plane of UX and while consulting the practitioner, I have come up with the main business needs for this website, as listed below:
- BUILD ONLINE PRESENCE
- INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT BOTH PRACTICES
- INCREASE POTENTIAL CLIENTS

Other needs came up during discussion with client but could not be implemented during this project as lack of time, readiness and programming languages for now.

# UX

__Why is this so special?__

During my research in planning and designing the website, I asked a few questions to some friends who could be potential clients and also the practitioner himself. From those questions and my own research of other websites and practice, came the user stories below.
Before the user stories, I wanted to add here a few questions asked and their answers.

1. What does the User expect?
	* I expect a professional looking and easy to navigate website with easy to read  information and easy to find contact details.
2. How a website should look credible and trustworthy?
	* This is very important. In my opinion websites for alternative medicine often look very dodgy, bad colours, font, very bad layout, not easy to read at all. It does not create trust. It creates the feeling that the person might not be credible at all.
3. What do you expect?
	* A website design that is ‘on brand’ with the practice. Use modern design, clean layout. It should look a bit more like a spa website and less like a car repair website
4. How should it look valuable enough for me to stay?
	* Easy to navigate tabs, good info on how to get in touch, clear prices, testimonials from existing clients, a nice bio/about page. No advertisements
5. When you go to a particular site, where do you go first?
	* Depends on why I visited the page, but in many cases to the ‘About’ tab to find out more about the person behind the product/brand


## User Stories and Features:

During the scope plane and while establishing the user stories for each page and making wireframes, the following features were decided.

This helped me to plan ahead and also to work through specific sprints to implement one feature at a time, answering one user story at a time...

__For the Home page__

### Features Left to Implement

### List of wireframes made before building the website

I used Balsamic tool for the wireframes and attached them to the directory in assets. I spent a considerable amount of time doing wireframes in details as I had no clue of design before and wanted to have a clear idea of how the website looked like.

- [Home]()
- [Home mobile]()
-

As always when implementing coding, these wireframes templates do not exactly reflect the final version of the website itself but they were very useful for me to have an approximate design in my head and to also share with the client.

During mentoring session, I was for example advised to push down some content in a separate section to improve user experience because of overloaded content.

The footer changed completely during coding phase while the navbar was greatly improved thanks to more option for color and fonts.

# Technologies Used
- This website used HTML and CSS programming languages.
- One feature also needed JS language which was provided by Simen Dehlin (mentor) via Slack
- [AWS Cloud9](https://www.awseducate.com/student/s/awssite) - I used __AWS Cloud9__ as my IDE for the development of this website.
- [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) - The website is using __Bootstrap4__ as the basic structure and grid of the website and to increase the responsiveness of the website.
- [FontAwesome](https://kit.fontawesome.com/f7e192f540.js) - The website is using __Font Awesome__ to display many icons on all pages
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)- The website uses __3 different Google fonts__ to style the content text and headings - Url imported in CSS
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7QMdT02TVnQ) - The website used __YouTube__ to host the video for the "Qigong page".
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) - The website uses __jQuery__ and __Popper.js__ to bring in Javascript which makes the navbar responsive
- [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - I have used __AutoPrefixer__ to make sure the css code worked on all browsers
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) - Website imported images from __Pexels__ for the full background image and all banners image
- [Tiny.jpg](https://tinyjpg.com) - I have used __Tinyjpg__ to compress all images of the website to increas the website loading on browser
- [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space) - I have used __ColorSpace__ to find matching colors for the website
- [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.cloud) - I have used __Balsamic__ to build the wireframes which I then exported to the IDE
- [Favicon converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) - I used Favicon converter to convert the logo into a favicon which I was able to insert in the asset folder and I tested it to be working

# Testing

### Final and official testing:
  * [W3 MarkUp validation](https://validator.w3.org)
  * [W3 CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

I checked the validity of my code at different times and received few errors on HTML markup which I worked on correcting. I did not get any errors with my CSS.
Example of an error in the MarkUp corrected:
- *The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.* I then removed frameborder from HTML and added border: none in CSS

### General testing


### Testing in different browsers



### Testing for each section

# Deployment
I have been using the Integrated development environment (IDE) [AWS Cloud9]() to develop this milestone project.
After creating a new GitHub repository, I linked it on the terminal of my IDE. I could then commit any update of my code and push it to the remote repository so it could be regularly backed up and accessed by others.

To deploy the website from the GitHub repository to its published GitHub page, I followed the steps as below:

__Enabling GitHub Pages to publish site from master as a publishing source__
1. Navigate to GitHub Pages site's repository
2. Under repository name, clicked Settings
3. Used "Select source drop-down menu" to select master as my GitHub Pages publishing source
4. Clicked save

When I submitted this Milestone project, I confirmed that the Development Branch and Master Branch are identical.

__HOW TO RUN CODE LOCALLY__

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository
2. Under the repository name, click Clone or download
3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repository
4. Open Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2 when git clone: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY 
7. Press Enter > Your local clone will be created.

### Work based on other code.
