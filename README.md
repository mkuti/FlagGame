For the second milestone project, I decided to make an interactive and educational game, so I could use Javascript functional programming which I have just learnt.

I like games as I believe anything can be learnt while having fun. Although I have not been playing a lot of online games or game apps myself, I am now a mum and often look for interesting, educative and well designed numeric games for my children.
Unfortunately, a lot of educative games do not have a great design and are not user friendly, especially when it comes to desktop or browser games.

My oldest son loves the planet, its continents, countries, and its flags, while he dreams of travelling when he stares at his globe :) He is also in the middle of learning to read and has fun with it.

I, myself, am passionate about discovering other cultures, learning and understanding languages and travelling generally in various countries while getting to know its people.
I remember as a child, one of the online game I played over and over again was a plane flying over the world map. The plane had a label behind with a country name written. The game was to click on the country on the map shown by the plane.
I learnt so many countries on all continents thanks to that game, which is still sometimes useful in my job up till now.

Finally, I want to become a software developer and web designer, partly because I want to use this new skill to help improving our world via contributing to great causes, which is another passion of mine.
Generally within my friend, family or colleagues circles, I noticed that many people have little clue about geography and cultures of other countries. They know little of flags although they get interested if you present it to them.
Also, there is a general ignorance of other's origins and cultural identities as well as an increasing behaviour of people forgetting or putting away where they come from because they want to blend in.
I believe in the richness of diversity so would love to bring more awareness about cultures, languages, and other labels which builds identity, while remind everybody that they should be proud of their origins.

In brief, I needed to make a game which could please my sons, uses a thematic which strongly interests me and finally to make a better world. Difficult task!

I made a final decision on making a game where the player would have to recognise a flag and match it to a country while random information would be showing about the country as a learning gift to the user.
For this, I would need to use two main APIs, one to display the flag and one to display random facts about the country once the match is successful.

The design of the game should be simple enough for a child to use it and attractive for an adult to play without much distractions and making them want to play more, to learn more...

Now more details about the design and structure of the game:
1. common mode, find the flag: display a flag and match it to a country among 4 options
2. reversed mode: display a country and match it to a flag among 4 options
3.

API I can use for the project:
https://restcountries.eu/
https://www.countryflags.io/
Google map JavaScript API

# UX
__Primary target audience?__ From 6years old kids and adults who are interested by other countries or want to test or deepen their knowledge of flags while learning a little about the world
- *Strategy* > make the game interactive, fun and educative

__What is the website for?__

During my research in planning and designing the website, I asked a few questions to some friends who could be potential clients and also the practitioner himself. From those questions and my own research of other websites and practice, came the user stories below.
Before the user stories, I wanted to add here a few questions asked and their answers.

1. What does the User expect?
	* I expect a professional looking and easy to navigate website with easy to read  information and easy to find contact details.
2. How a website should look credible and trustworthy?
	* This is very important. In my opinion websites for alternative medicine often look very dodgy, bad colours, font, very bad layout, not easy to read at all. It does not create trust. It creates the feeling that the person might not be credible at all.
3. What do you expect?
	* A website design that is ‘on brand’ with the practice. Use modern design, clean layout. It should look a bit more like a spa website and less like a car repair website
4. How should it look valuable enough for me to stay?
	* Easy to navigate tabs, good info on how to get in touch, clear prices, testimonials from existing clients, a nice bio/about page. No advertisements
5. When you go to a particular site, where do you go first?
	* Depends on why I visited the page, but in many cases to the ‘About’ tab to find out more about the person behind the product/brand


## User Stories and Features:

During the scope plane and while establishing the user stories for each page and making wireframes, the following features were decided.

This helped me to plan ahead and also to work through specific sprints to implement one feature at a time, answering one user story at a time...

__For the Home page__

### Main existing Features
* Feature 1 -

### Features Left to Implement

### List of wireframes made before building the website

I used Balsamic tool for the wireframes and attached them to the directory in assets. I spent a considerable amount of time doing wireframes in details as I had no clue of design before and wanted to have a clear idea of how the website looked like.

- [Home]()
- [Home mobile]()
-

As always when implementing coding, these wireframes templates do not exactly reflect the final version of the website itself but they were very useful for me to have an approximate design in my head and to also share with the client.

During mentoring session, I was for example advised to push down some content in a separate section to improve user experience because of overloaded content.

The footer changed completely during coding phase while the navbar was greatly improved thanks to more option for color and fonts.

# Technologies Used
- This website used HTML and CSS programming languages.
- One feature also needed JS language which was provided by Simen Dehlin (mentor) via Slack
- [AWS Cloud9](https://www.awseducate.com/student/s/awssite) - I used __AWS Cloud9__ as my IDE for the development of this website.
- [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) - The website is using __Bootstrap4__ as the basic structure and grid of the website and to increase the responsiveness of the website.
- [FontAwesome](https://kit.fontawesome.com/f7e192f540.js) - The website is using __Font Awesome__ to display many icons on all pages
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)- The website uses __3 different Google fonts__ to style the content text and headings - Url imported in CSS
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7QMdT02TVnQ) - The website used __YouTube__ to host the video for the "Qigong page".
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) - The website uses __jQuery__ and __Popper.js__ to bring in Javascript which makes the navbar responsive
- [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - I have used __AutoPrefixer__ to make sure the css code worked on all browsers
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) - Website imported images from __Pexels__ for the full background image and all banners image
- [Tiny.jpg](https://tinyjpg.com) - I have used __Tinyjpg__ to compress all images of the website to increas the website loading on browser
- [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space) - I have used __ColorSpace__ to find matching colors for the website
- [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.cloud) - I have used __Balsamic__ to build the wireframes which I then exported to the IDE
- [Favicon converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) - I used Favicon converter to convert the logo into a favicon which I was able to insert in the asset folder and I tested it to be working

# Testing

### Final and official testing:
  * [W3 MarkUp validation](https://validator.w3.org)
  * [W3 CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

I checked the validity of my code at different times and received few errors on HTML markup which I worked on correcting. I did not get any errors with my CSS.
Example of an error in the MarkUp corrected:
- *The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.* I then removed frameborder from HTML and added border: none in CSS

### General testing


### Testing in different browsers



### Testing for each section

# Deployment
I have been using the Integrated development environment (IDE) [AWS Cloud9]() to develop this milestone project.
After creating a new GitHub repository, I linked it on the terminal of my IDE. I could then commit any update of my code and push it to the remote repository so it could be regularly backed up and accessed by others.

To deploy the website from the GitHub repository to its published GitHub page, I followed the steps as below:

__Enabling GitHub Pages to publish site from master as a publishing source__
1. Navigate to GitHub Pages site's repository
2. Under repository name, clicked Settings
3. Used "Select source drop-down menu" to select master as my GitHub Pages publishing source
4. Clicked save

When I submitted this Milestone project, I confirmed that the Development Branch and Master Branch are identical.

__HOW TO RUN CODE LOCALLY__

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository
2. Under the repository name, click Clone or download
3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repository
4. Open Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2 when git clone: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY 
7. Press Enter > Your local clone will be created.

### Work based on other code.
